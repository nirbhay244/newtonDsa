Problem Statement
Alexa will practice golf. Her objective is to get a carry distance that is a multiple of K, while she can only make a carry distance of between A and B (inclusive).
If she can achieve the objective, print OK; if he cannot, print NG.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer K denoting carry distance
The second line of the input contains two space-separated integers A and B denoting the range.

Constraints
All values in the input are integers.
1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 1000
1 ≤ K ≤ 1000
Output
If she can achieve the objective, print OK; if he cannot, print NG.
