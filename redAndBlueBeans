Red and Blue Beans
Time Limit: 2 sec
Memory Limit: 128000 kB
Problem Statement
You have r red and b blue beans. You'd like to distribute them among several (maybe, one) packets in such a way that each packet:
1. Has at least one red bean (or the number of red beans ri ≤ 1);
2. Has at least one blue bean (or the number of blue beans bi ≤ 1);
3. The number of red and blue beans should differ in no more than d (or |ri−bi| ≤ d)
Can you distribute all beans?
Input
The input consists of three space- separated integers r, b, and d — the number of red and blue beans and the maximum absolute difference in each packet.

Constraints
1 ≤ r, b ≤109
0 ≤ d ≤109
Output
If you can distribute all beans, print Yes. Otherwise, print No.
